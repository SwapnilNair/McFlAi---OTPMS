Pyspark 3.3.0
Postgres 12.14


Kafka and Spark are connected and streaming now.

God help us clean the input stream and convert it into a df, can't seem to be able to do it on the fly.

.show() doesn't work on streams, do be warned

I really don't want to write a constructor for this mess :( 

Why is this not working
