## McFlAi - On Time Performance Monitoring System
A project built for the course Database Technologies. An end to end pipeline using Apache Spark, Apache Kafka and Zookeeper to stream and analyze performance metrics for airlines is real time. 
Metrics included average flight delays, turnaround times, airborne time and more.
All queries were execued using Spark dataframes and Spark SQL and tried in batch mode and streaming mode.
Supported multiple subscribers like Airlines, Airports and Manufactureers who could view specific real time values hassle free.

The dataset we ran this on is approximately 11 Gigs, so definitely not uploading that here

Overall this was a fantastic experience and dealing with handling huge datasets with millions of rows and columns was a dream task.

**Technologies used for this** 
1. Apache Spark Streaming and Spark SQL.
2. Apache Kafka 
3. Postgres/MySQL.
4. Zookeeper.
5. Python
